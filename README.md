## Inspiration  
The inspiration came from my desire to combine a classic trivia game with the magic of Christmas. I wanted to create something simple yet visually appealing that could entertain players and bring a bit of festive spirit.  

## What it does  
*Snoo Christmas Trivia* is an interactive 3D trivia game where players answer general knowledge questions in a festive environment. The experience takes place in a Christmas-themed scene featuring colorful lights and a decorated Christmas tree at the center.  

## How I built it  
I developed the project in **one day** using:  
- **Svelte and Threlte**: to handle the game's logic and structure.  
- **Three.js**: to create and render the 3D scene.  
- **Blender**: to model and texture the 3D assets, such as the Christmas tree and decorations.  
- I focused on integrating dynamic lights and festive colors to capture the holiday atmosphere.  

## Challenges I ran into  
One of the biggest challenges was optimizing the assets created in **Blender** to ensure smooth performance with **Three.js** on the web. Additionally, fine-tuning the lighting and shadows to look natural and festive required time and constant testing.  

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of  
- Developing a complete and visually appealing game in such a short amount of time.  
- Creating an immersive 3D Christmas-themed scene with details like lights and a decorated tree.  
- Efficiently integrating tools like Svelte, Threlte, and Three.js for optimal performance.  

## What I learned  
- I improved my skills in integrating **Three.js** with **Svelte** and **Threlte**.  
- I learned how to optimize 3D models from **Blender** for web applications without sacrificing visual quality.  
- The importance of visual details, such as lighting and scene composition, to create an immersive experience.  

## What's next for Snoo Christmas Trivia  
In the future, I would like to:  
- Add a scoring system and timer to make it more competitive.  
- Create more questions and difficulty levels to diversify the experience.  
- Implement a multiplayer mode so players can compete against each other.  
- Enhance the scene with interactive animations and additional visual effects.
